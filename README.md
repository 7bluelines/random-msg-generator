# Random Message Generator Project
## Learn Programming Languages!
### Project Description
This project generates a message about a particular programming language and its associated fields and skills. The function 'randomNum' takes in an array of values and generates a random number from within the range of the array's length. The 'getLanguage' function uses the random number generated from the 'randomNum' to grab a language from 'toInsert', as well as a field and skill from within that language. 'message' creates an array of strings which encorporates the language, field and skill grabbed from 'getLanguage' and returns a random string from that array. 'toInsert' is an array of arrays containing the various programming languages, fields, and skills.
### How to Use
